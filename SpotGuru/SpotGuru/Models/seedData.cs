Built over a period of more than 600 years, mainly in a Baroque style, the sanctuary illustrates the European tradition of the  Sacri Monti  (sacred mountains), promoted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in the 16th century  , in reaction to the Protestant Reformation. The Bom Jesus ensemble is centered on a  Via Crucis  that runs along the western flank of Mt. It has a series of chapels that house sculptures evoking the Passion of Christ, fountains, allegorical sculptures and classical gardens. The  Via Crucisleads to the church, built between 1784 and 1811. The granite buildings have plastered, whitewashed facades framed by exposed stone masonry. The famous Staircase of the Five Senses, which features walls, steps, fountains, statues and other ornamental elements, is the most emblematic Baroque work within the property. They are framed by lush woods and surrounded by a picturesque park which, masterfully situated on the steep hill, strongly contributes to the landscape value of the whole. (source: UNESCO)",
